There is a reason that the large Congress has been decentralized: The pandemic is not over. We are trying to make the event in Potsdam as safe as possible for all participants.

Therefore:

1. Indoors, FFP2 (or above) masks are strongly recommended.

1. Please test yourselves daily. If you can, use the "Bürgertest". We have a limited number of self-tests on site. (Donations appreciated.)

1. If you experience flue-like symptoms (even during the event), please stay at home. Refunds are possible, get in contact.

1. Derogatory remarks towards other participants wearing a mask will not be tolerated.
