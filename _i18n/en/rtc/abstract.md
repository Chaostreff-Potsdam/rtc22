    Dear creatures of all galaxies,
</p>
<p>
    The Chaos Communication Congress of the CCC has been cancelled. You now have a lot of time between 27th and 30th of December and wish to reconnect? You have exciting hacking projects or ideas on how to improve society and are looking for a place to share them? We can help with that!
</p>
<p>
    There will be a small on-site event at freiLand Potsdam. We call it “RTC - Reconnect To Chaos!”.
</p>
<p>
    We have a stage, several workshop rooms and an interesting outdoor area. We stream the talks and there will be a wide variety of workshops, music and arts - based on your contributions!
</p>
<p>
    Your<br>
    Chaostreff Potsdam (CCCP)
